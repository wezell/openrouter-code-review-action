"""Score Codex baseline findings against the labeled ground-truth dataset.

Sub-AC 2.3.2 deliverable. Sub-AC 2.3.1 defined the labeled dataset
(``eval/labeled_dataset/dataset.yaml``); this module is its consumer.
For every PR in the bake-off sample registry, it walks the Codex
baseline findings (``eval/runs/<pr_id>/codex.json``), applies the
§4.5 matching rules against the ground-truth entries for that PR, and
writes a per-PR "scored" artifact:

    eval/runs/<pr_id>/codex_scored.json

Each Codex finding gets one **scored finding** record:

* ``matched_dataset_id`` — id of the best-matching ground-truth entry,
  or ``null`` when nothing in the dataset corresponds to this finding.
* ``assigned_label`` — ``TP`` if the matched entry is labeled ``TP``,
  ``FP`` if it is labeled ``FP``, ``UNMATCHED`` when no dataset entry
  could be paired (per methodology §3 these *count* as findings the
  labeling pass needs to triage; they do not silently drop).
* ``match_quality`` — one of ``"exact_line"`` (line ranges overlap),
  ``"line_proximity"`` (within ± tolerance lines), ``"keyword_only"``
  (matched on keyword overlap because the dataset entry's
  ``line_range_status`` is ``unverified``), or ``"none"``.
* ``match_distance`` — closest-line distance between the model finding's
  range and the dataset entry's range (``None`` for keyword-only and
  unmatched records). Mirrors the same field on
  ``evaluation/bakeoff/comparison/`` records so a labeler can compare
  the two views without re-deriving the proximity metric.

The output format is intentionally a *projection* — it does **not**
re-decide TP/FP. It records what the dataset says and how confidently
the matcher associated each Codex finding with that dataset entry.
The labeling pass (methodology §2) still adjudicates ambiguous matches;
this artifact is what makes that pass cheap.

Pending tolerance
-----------------

Codex baseline captures may be in ``capture.status = "pending"`` (the
default committed placeholder), ``"failed"`` (live capture errored), or
``"captured"`` (real findings present). The runner treats every
non-captured state as *not yet measurable* and writes a
``status = "skipped"`` scored artifact with a free-form ``notes`` field
that explains why. Real scoring only happens for ``status = "captured"``
artifacts. This mirrors the methodology §2.3 rule 5 discipline that we
never paper over missing captures with synthesized scores.

Sample-level rollup
-------------------

After per-PR records are written, the runner emits
``eval/runs/_codex_scoring_summary.json`` with status counts and
per-PR aggregate (matched_tp / matched_fp / unmatched / dataset
coverage). That single rollup is what downstream Sub-AC 1.5 (the
parity score) reads first to decide which PRs are score-ready.

Usage
-----

::

    python -m eval.score_codex_baseline                 # score every sample PR
    python -m eval.score_codex_baseline --pr-id dotcms-core-35567
    python -m eval.score_codex_baseline --check         # CI-style drift check

The ``--check`` mode rebuilds in memory and exits non-zero if the
on-disk scored artifacts differ from the rebuild (excluding the
volatile ``generated_at`` timestamp). Re-run without ``--check`` to
refresh.
